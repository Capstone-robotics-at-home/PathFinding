"# PathFinding" 
# Astar
* Run Astar.py
* Using AStar algorithm to find the best way to get to the target and avoid obstacles 

# RL_Weibo Folder
* Run run_RL.py 
* A RL reinforcement training with Polytope
* Contributed by Weibo Huang 

# Simple_RL 
* Run simple_RL_run.py
* Build A simple RL training environment 
* waiting for improvement 
* The next step might be: Use A* algorithm for the first serveral times.
* What about add the position of the target to the state?
